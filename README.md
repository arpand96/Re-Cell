Business Problem and Context:

ReCell, a startup operating in the used and refurbished device market, is the need to develop a dynamic
pricing strategy for their products.
The objective is to leverage machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically building a linear regression
model, to predict the price of used phones and tablets. Furthermore, ReCell aims to identify the key
factors that significantly influence the pricing of these devices.
By solving this problem, ReCell can optimize their pricing decisions, improve profitability, and gain a
competitive advantage in the growing market of used and refurbished devices.

The Re-Cell project involves developing a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices.
The solution approach includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data, data
preprocessing for cleaning and feature engineering, and building a linear regression model to predict
device prices.
Assumptions of the linear regression model are tested, and the model's performance is evaluated using
various metrics.
Actionable insights and recommendations are provided based on the modelâ€™s results.
